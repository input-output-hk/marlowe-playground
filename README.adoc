[[cache-warning]]
[IMPORTANT]
====
DO NOT IGNORE THIS

If you want to use Nix with this project, make sure to set up the xref:iohk-binary-cache[IOHK binary cache].
If you do not do this, you will end up building GHC, which takes several hours.
If you find yourself building GHC, STOP and fix the cache.

== Documentation

== Working with the project

=== How to submit an issue

Issues can be filed in the https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-playground/issues[GitHub Issue tracker].

[[how-to-develop]]
=== How to develop and contribute to the project

See link:CONTRIBUTING{outfilesuffix}[CONTRIBUTING], which describes our processes in more detail including development environments.

=== How to build the project's artifacts

This section contains information about how to build the project's artifacts for independent usage.
For development work see <<how-to-develop>> for more information.

[[prerequisites]]

==== Prerequisites

The Haskell libraries in the Marlowe project are built with `cabal` and Nix.
The other artifacts (docs etc.) are also most easily built with Nix.

===== Nix

Install https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix] (recommended). following the instructions on the https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix website].

Make sure you have read and understood the xref:cache-warning[cache warning].
DO NOT IGNORE THIS.

See <<nix-advice>> for further advice on using Nix.

===== Non-Nix

You can build some of the Haskell packages without Nix, but this is not recommended and we don't guarantee that these prerequisites are sufficient.
If you use Nix, these tools are provided for you via `shell.nix`, and you do *not* need to install them yourself.

* If you want to build our Haskell packages with https://www.haskell.org/cabal/[`cabal`], then install it.
* If you want to build our Haskell packages with https://haskellstack.org/[`stack`], then install it.

[[building-with-nix]]
==== How to build the Haskell packages and other artifacts with Nix

Run `nix build .#marlowe-playground-server:exe:marlowe-playground-server` from the root to build the Playground backend service.

Try `nix flake show` to see the packages available to build.

==== How to build the Haskell packages with `cabal`

The Haskell packages can be built directly with `cabal`.
We do this during development (see <<how-to-develop>>).
The best way is to do this is inside a `nix-shell`.

[NOTE]
====
For fresh development setups, you also need to run `cabal update`.
====

Run `cabal build all` from the root to build all artifacts.


=== Deployment

The Marlowe Playground is automatically deployed upon certain pushes to GitHub

* https://marlowe-playground-staging.plutus.aws.iohkdev.io/[Marlowe Playground staging] and https://marlowe-run-staging.plutus.aws.iohkdev.io/[Marlowe Run staging] are deployed from every commit pushed to `main` (these URLs subject to change)

For more details, including instructions for setting up ad hoc testing deployments, see https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-ops[the plutus-ops repo].


[[nix-advice]]
== Nix

[[iohk-binary-cache]]
=== How to set up the IOHK binary caches

Adding the IOHK binary cache to your Nix configuration will speed up
builds a lot, since many things will have been built already by our CI.

If you find you are building packages that are not defined in this
repository, or if the build seems to take a very long time then you may
not have this set up properly.

To set up the cache:

. On non-NixOS, edit `/etc/nix/nix.conf` and add the following lines:
+
----
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
substituters        = "https://cache.nixos.org" "https://cache.iog.io https://marlowe-playground.cachix.org"
trusted-public-keys = "hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= marlowe-playground.cachix.org-1:8TmdbVgcB4QzTmuzLxNdaCxdc8ZVI9S8eeeXsY9stxo="
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you don't have an `/etc/nix/nix.conf` or don't want to edit it, you may add the `nix.conf` lines to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` instead.
You must be a https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-multi-user[trusted user] to do this.
====
. On NixOS, set the following NixOS options:
+
----
nix.settings = {
  experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
  substituters = [
    "https://cache.nixos.org"
    "https://cache.iog.io"
  ];
  trusted-public-keys = [
    "hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ="
  ];
};
----


=== Nix on macOS

Nix on macOS can be a bit tricky. In particular, sandboxing is disabled by default, which can lead to strange failures.

These days it should be safe to turn on sandboxing on macOS with a few exceptions. Consider setting the following Nix settings, in the same way as in xref:iohk-binary-cache[previous section]:

----
sandbox = true
extra-sandbox-paths = /System/Library/Frameworks /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks /usr/lib /private/tmp /private/var/tmp /usr/bin/env
----

Changes to `/etc/nix/nix.conf` may require a restart of the nix daemon in order to take affect. Restart the nix daemon by running the following commands:

----
sudo launchctl stop org.nixos.nix-daemon
sudo launchctl start org.nixos.nix-daemon
----

[[nix-build-attributes]]
=== Which attributes to use to build different artifacts

link:./flake.nix[`flake.nix`] defines the packages that you can build from this repository.
These can be built using `nix build`.
For example:

----
nix build .#generate-purs
----

.Other builds
To see other packages that can be built or run, execute

----
nix flake show
----

[NOTE]
====
You might need to comment other build systems inside flake.nix
