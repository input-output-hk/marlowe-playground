=== How to develop and contribute to the project

See link:CONTRIBUTING{outfilesuffix}[CONTRIBUTING], which describes our processes in more detail including development environments.

=== How to build the project's artifacts

This section contains information about how to build the project's artifacts for independent usage.
For development work see <<how-to-develop>> for more information.

[[prerequisites]]

==== Prerequisites

The Haskell libraries in the Marlowe project are built with `cabal` and Nix.
The other artifacts (docs etc.) are also most easily built with Nix.

===== Nix

This repository uses nix to provide a development and build environment.

For instructions on how to install and configure nix (including how to enable access to our binary caches), refer to link:https://github.com/input-output-hk/iogx/blob/main/doc/nix-setup-guide.md[this document]. 

If you already have nix installed and configured, you may enter the development shell by running `nix develop`.

===== Non-Nix

You can build some of the Haskell packages without Nix, but this is not recommended and we don't guarantee that these prerequisites are sufficient.
If you use Nix, these tools are provided for you via `shell.nix`, and you do *not* need to install them yourself.

* If you want to build our Haskell packages with https://www.haskell.org/cabal/[`cabal`], then install it.
* If you want to build our Haskell packages with https://haskellstack.org/[`stack`], then install it.

[NOTE]
====
For fresh development setups, you also need to run `cabal update`.
====

Run `cabal build all` from the root to build all artifacts.

=== Deployment

The Marlowe Playground is automatically deployed upon certain pushes to GitHub

* https://marlowe-playground-staging.plutus.aws.iohkdev.io/[Marlowe Playground staging] and https://marlowe-run-staging.plutus.aws.iohkdev.io/[Marlowe Run staging] are deployed from every commit pushed to `main` (these URLs subject to change)

For more details, including instructions for setting up ad hoc testing deployments, see https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-ops[the plutus-ops repo].
